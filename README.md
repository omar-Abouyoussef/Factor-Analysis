The Covid-19 pandemic obliged people around the world to stay home and self-isolate, with a number of negative psychological consequences. This study focuses on the protective role of character strengths in sustaining mental health and self-efficacy during lock down. Data were collected from 944 Italian respondents (mean age = 37.24 years, SD = 14.50) by means of an online survey investigating character strengths, psychological distress and Covid-19 related self-efficacy one month after lock down began.

Perform Principle component analysis and compare your results with the result of the study.

Perform cluster analysis using the four strengths factors extracted, namely transcendence, interpersonal, openness and restraint and validate your analysis.

Perform Multivariate regression

# Findings
Variables such as Creativity, Curiosity, and Bravery are associated to strength factor Openness. Meanwhile, variables such as the Zest, Hope, and Gratitude contribute to strength factor Transcendence. 

Similar to the original paper, Transcendence had a significant inverse association with psychological distress and anxiety (DASS_21), and a positive relation with self-efficacy (GHQ). Openness factor exhibited a direct relation with psychological distress.

K-means was then applied to cluster people who are prone to or had bad mental health during lockdown. The first group who were more open; creative and curious individuals, were associated with Depression and anxiety as evidenced by the regression analysis were classified as bad mental health during lockdown. Transcendence had a negative association with depression and self-efficacy, thus people with hope, gratitude and zest were classified with good mental health during lockdown.
